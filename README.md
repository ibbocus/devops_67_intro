## What is Devops?

DevOps is a software development method which focuses on communication, integration, and collaboration among IT professionals to enables rapid deployment of products.

DevOps is a culture that promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Team. This allows deploying code to production faster and in an automated way. It helps to increases an organization's speed to deliver application and services. It can be defined as an alignment of development and IT operation. 

## Why should we use Devops?

1. Shorter Development Cycles, Faster Innovation
  a. With a combined development and operations team, applications are ready for use much more quickly. This is important, since companies succeed based on their ability to innovate faster than their competitors do.
  
2. Reduced Deployment Failures, Rollbacks, and Time to Recover
  a. Part of the reason teams experience deployment failures is due to programming defects. The shorter development cycles with DevOps promote more frequent code releases. This, in turn, makes it easier to spot code defects. Therefore, teams can reduce the number of deployment failures using agile programming principles that call for collaboration and modular programming. Rollbacks are similarly easier to manage because, when necessary, only some modules are affected.
  
3. Improved Communication and Collaboration
  a. DevOps improves the software development culture. Combined teams are happier and more productive. The culture becomes focused on performance rather than individual goals.

4. Increased Efficiencies
  a. Acceleration tools are another opportunity for increasing efficiency. For example:
    
  - Scalable infrastructures, such as cloud-based platforms, increase the access the team has to hardware resources. As a result, testing and deployment operations   speed up.
  - Build acceleration tools can be used to compile code more quickly.
  - Parallel workflows can be embedded into the continuous delivery chain to avoid delays; one team waits for another to complete its work.
  - Using one environment avoids the useless task of transferring data between environments. This means you donâ€™t have to use one environment for development, a different environment for testing, and a third for deployment.
  
5. Reduced Costs and IT Headcount
  a. All of the DevOps benefits translate to reduced overall costs and IT headcount requirements. 
  
  
 ## Challenges of Devops
 
 1. Overcoming the Dev versus Ops mentality
 
 2. Moving from legacy infrastructure to microservices
 
 3. Too much focus on tools
 
 4. Resistance to change
 
 5. Dev and Ops toolset clashes
 
 ## How DevOps benefit the business
 
 1. Faster delivery time
 
 2. High collaboration between teams (Business/Dev/Ops)
 
 3. Greater customer experiences
 
 4. Early defect detection
 
 5. Continuous Release and Deployment
 
 6. Innovative mindset
